          <p>Hi {{ proposal.customer }}, </p>

          <p>It was pleasure getting to meet you and review your project requirements, I believe it is a great fit for the types of applications that I build out.Please feel free to checkout some of my past projects <a href = "{{proposal.portfolio_url}}">here</a></p>

          <p>To successfully build out the application I will be utilizing {{proposal.tools}}, and a number of other tools to ensure that the projects follows industry wide best practices</p>

          <p>Ensuring that you fully informed is one of my top priorities, so in addition to incorporating everything we discussed, I will also be creating a project management dashboard and sending you a project management dashboard and sending you a project update message daily so that you can have a transparent view of the development as it takes place</p>

          <p>To accomplish the project and meet the requirements that we discussed, I am estimating that it will take {{ proposal.estimated_hours }} hours in development time to complete. The project should take {{proposal.weeks_to_complete }} weeks to complete and with my hourly rate of {{proposal.hourly_rate}}/hour, the estimated total will be {{proposal.hourly_rate * proposal.estimated_hours }}.</p>

          <p>The next step from here is to set up a meetimg to finalize the project and sign contracts</p>

          <p>I am excited to working with you and build out this project</p>
